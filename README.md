## ðŸ“ˆ Overview
**RR Binazir Chart** is an Expert Advisor (EA) for **MetaTrader 4** that visually displays rectangles and calculates **Risk-to-Reward (RR) ratios** for your open trades.  
It draws:
- A **red rectangle** from Entry to Stop-Loss (SL)
- A **green rectangle** from Entry to Take-Profit (TP)
- The **RR ratio** in the top-right corner of the chart with one decimal precision  

Whenever you modify your SL or TP, the rectangles and RR label update automatically. When a trade is closed, the shapes are removed.
